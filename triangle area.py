base=input("Enter the length of the base of the triangle >") #asks the base length
base=float(base)#float declares 'base' as a number.It allows floating decimals.
height=input("Enter the perpendicular height of the triangle >")#The answer is saved as width.
height=float(height)#float declares 'height' as a number. It allows floating decimals.
area=base*height/2 #simple area calculation
print("The area is", area)

#**2 =to the power of 2
#**4 =to the power of 4
